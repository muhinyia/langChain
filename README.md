# 🚀 LangChain Learning Playground

Welcome to my LangChain learning repository!  
This is a personal space where I explore, experiment, and document my journey into the world of **LangChain** – a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs).

## 📚 What is LangChain?

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is an open-source framework that enables developers to build applications powered by language models. It provides tools for chaining LLM calls, working with agents, memory, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and more.
